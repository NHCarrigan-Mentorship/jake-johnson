User stories are reflected in the issues. Issues are not grouped with large categories and sub issues currently to make it easier to visually scan, internalize, and analyze ALL issues/ tasks / user stories that need to be addressed and be able to make snap judgements about what to work on next.

Project is a open-ended wishlist web application to give people more freedom, allow more taste preferences, and encourage more engagement with local economies, businesses, and creatives.
